                              INSTALL-FILE for the iRRAM, 
                  a software package for exact real arithmetic in C++
                                 version 2014_01.

###############################################################################

This version is released and maintained by Norbert Mueller (mueller@uni-trier.de).

A description of the package and the underlying theory can be found in

   doc/irram.ps
          (presented at the
           Workshop on Computability and Complexity in Analysis,
           2000, Swansea/UK)


Additionally you might have a look at 

          http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/iRRAM/

for new versions and enhanced documentation...

COMPILATON

- untar the package in some directory "$BASEDIR":

  cd $BASEDIR; tar xvf iRRAM_2014_01.tar.bz2   
  
- If you are impatient, just run 
	./QUICKINSTALL_run_me 
  from within the iRRAM directory.
 
- If you want to know more of the details, please read on and/or read the FAQ!

- Compilation should be possible with a recent g++ on Linux, simply try the usual
  
  cd iRRAM_2014_01
  ./configure
  make
  make install

  This will also check your system for the availability of the multiple precision libraries 
  GMP and MPFR. If these libraries are not installed in the usual places, you may use the 
  following options for the configuration:

    --with-include-path=DIR    additional path for includes
    --with-lib-path=DIR        additional path for libraries

  So if you have installed both the gmp- and the mpfr-libraries as well as the 
  additional include files in a directory MY_MP_INST, then

     ./configure --with-include-path=MY_MP_INST/include --with-lib-path=MY_MP_INST/lib

  should be sufficient. Be careful: At runtime you might need an extra

     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=MY_MP_INST/lib
     
  to use the installed shared libraries! Again please have a look a the FAQ!

- In $BASEDIR/iRRAM/examples so will find some examples, e.g.:

  etest:        compute a number of decimals of e=2.718281... 
  pi_example:   explained in the introduction is doc/irram.ps
  matrix:       a few simple applications of matrix arithmetic 
  hilbert:      Inversion of the badly conditioned hilbert matrix
  itsyst:       compute the iteration x=3.75 (1-x)x for 
  swanseatest,swanseatest-2: a few tests for a competition at the
                CCA2000 workshop in Swansea/Wales
  timings-iRRAM gives timings for basic function using the choosen backend
  timings-MPFR-iRRAM gives timings for MPFR, but with
                extensions, showing how the iRRAM itself can be used 
                from within other software!

You should call these examples once in the form 
  
   program 

to hide the iterations and once simply as 

   program -d

to see the iterations.


- The easiest way to compile an own program "my_first_test.cc" is as follows:
  Put the program into the directory  "$BASEDIR/iRRAM/examples/" 
  and just call

     make my_first_test
