Version 2014-01
 - moving to github
 - significant changes in the FUNCTION interface, 
    which even needs an increased major library version

Version 2013-01
 - new build structure allowing a system wide installation
 - uncountably ;-) many small changes
 
Version 2009-01 
 - removed rarely used backends LRGMP and cGMP

Version 2007-01
 - fixes some bugs in the RATIONAL interface
 - small modifications due to warnings from gcc version 4.1.3
 - small changes in the build process for the static/dynamic libraries

Version 2006-01
 - small modifications to the build process

Version 2005-03
 - port of backends LRGMP and cGMP to x86_64

Version 2005-02
 - added support for MPFR version 2.2.x

Version 2005-01:
 - many functions have been optimized and converted to inline
 - some bugs fixed

Version 2004-02:
 - complete change of the I/O routines from C-style to C++-style
 - port to x86_64
 - almost all "long" variables have been converted to "int"

 - new backend cGMP with hashing techniques (impressive benchmarks...)
 - small changes in data structure of REAL (size is precomputed)
 - initial steps to catch over/underflow

Version 2003-07:
 - sizes of caches for multi-valued function now grow dynamically
 - added function arg(z) and log(z) for complex arguments z

Version 2003-06:
 - small changes in the Makefile-structures
 - correction of the Makefile in user_programs to allow profiling

Version 2003-05:
 - many additional functions for type changes
 - esp. new constructors RATIONAL(RATIONAL) and INTEGER(INTEGER)
   
Version 2003-03:

 - type INTERVAL for intervals of exact real numbers
 - LR backend removed, LRGMP backend fixed
 - shared libraries

Version 2003-01:

 - type LAZY_BOOLEAN

Versions 2002-xxx

  - only small cosmetic improvements

Version 2001c:

 - types INTEGER and RATIONAL 
 - many aditional COMPLEX functions
 - LR backend disable (at the moment...)

Version 2001a/b:

 - new backend: MPFR (use at least MPFR 2001!)
 - configure script
 - choice of backend at configure or compile time 
 - possibility of reexport of computed functions to backends GMP and MPFR,
   but still in experimental form (no NaNs etc.)
